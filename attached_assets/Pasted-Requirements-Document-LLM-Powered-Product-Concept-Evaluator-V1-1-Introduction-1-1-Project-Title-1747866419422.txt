Requirements Document: LLM-Powered Product Concept Evaluator (V1)
1. Introduction
1.1. Project Title: LLM-Powered Product Concept Evaluator (Working Backwards Simulator) - V1
1.2. Project Goal: To create a web application that takes a user's product idea and simulates Amazon's "Working Backwards" process using a sequence of LLM-driven steps. The application will generate a Press Release/FAQ (PRFAQ) document and a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) plan. V1 will focus on transparency, displaying the inputs and outputs of each step to the user.
1.3. Target User: Product managers, entrepreneurs, innovators, or anyone looking to flesh out a product idea using a structured, AI-assisted process.
2. Core Functionality
2.1. User Input Product Idea: The user can input their product concept via a simple text field.
2.2. Sequential LLM-driven "Working Backwards" Process: The application will orchestrate a series of calls to a powerful Gemini Large Language Model (referred to as "Gemini Pro" or the closest equivalent high-capability model available via API). Each call will represent a step in the Working Backwards process, with the LLM adopting a specific persona and acting on the input from the previous step.
2.3. Display of Intermediate and Final Outputs: The UI will clearly display the progress of the simulation, showing the current step being processed, the input to that step, the LLM persona involved, and the generated output for that step. The final PRFAQ and MLP plan will also be displayed.
3. Technology Stack (Recommended)
3.1. Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Consider a simple framework like vanilla JS or a lightweight option if preferred by the coding agent (e.g., Svelte, Vue.js for minimal setup).
The UI should be clean, responsive, and focus on displaying information clearly.
3.2. Backend:
Python (Flask or FastAPI recommended for simplicity and performance).
The backend will handle:
Receiving user input from the frontend.
Orchestrating the sequence of LLM calls.
Formatting prompts for the LLM.
Sending requests to the Gemini API.
Processing LLM responses.
Sending step-by-step updates and final results back to the frontend.
3.3. LLM API:
Google Gemini API.
Utilize a powerful and generally available model (e.g., "Gemini Pro" or the most capable equivalent model accessible via API for text generation tasks).
API key management will be required (the coding agent should implement a secure way to handle this, e.g., environment variables).
4. Detailed Workflow and LLM Interactions
The application will execute the following steps sequentially. For each step, the UI should update to show the current stage and its output.
Step 0: User Input
Action: User enters their product idea into a text area and clicks a "Start Evaluation" button.
UI Display:
Input field for product idea.
"Start Evaluation" button.
Step 1: Draft Press Release (PM Persona)
Input: The user's raw product idea.
LLM Persona: "You are an expert Amazon Product Manager. Your goal is to draft an initial internal press release for a new product idea. This press release should be customer-obsessed, focusing on the problem this product solves, its core benefits, and how it will delight customers. Be bold and visionary."

"--- Evaluation Complete ---"
5. User Interface (UI) Flow and Display
5.1. Initial Input Screen:
A clear title for the application.
A brief explanation of what the application does.
A multi-line text area labeled "Enter Your Product Idea Here:".
A button labeled "Start Evaluation".
5.2. Processing Screen / Output Display Area:
Once "Start Evaluation" is clicked, this area becomes active.
It should dynamically display the progress. For each step (1 through 6):
Display the step number and name (e.g., "Step 1: Drafting Press Release (Product Manager Persona)").
Optionally, display the key input(s) to this step (e.g., "Input: {User's product idea}"). This can be collapsed by default to save space for longer inputs.
Clearly display the "Output: {LLM_generated_text_for_this_step}". The output should be well-formatted (preserving line breaks from the LLM).
A visual indicator (e.g., "Processing...") could be shown while the LLM call is in progress for the current step.
The display should scroll as new steps are completed and their outputs are added.
5.3. Final Output Display:
After Step 6, a message like "Evaluation Complete!" should appear.
The full PRFAQ (from Step 5) and the MLP Plan (from Step 6) should be clearly presented, perhaps with options to easily copy the text.
6. Error Handling
6.1. LLM API Call Failures:
If a call to the Gemini API fails (e.g., network error, API error):
The process should halt at that step.
A user-friendly error message should be displayed in the UI, e.g., "An error occurred while processing Step X: [Brief error description]. Please try again later."
Log detailed error information in the backend console for debugging.
